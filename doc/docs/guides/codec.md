⚠️*This section's examples only works based on `WebCodecs`, which Chromium-based clients support. *

In this section, we will talk about encoding and decoding, which involve uncompressed frames I/O.
For example, we can input frames from camera or screen recording, or output frames to canvas.
Here below introduce two examples, which you can check in the [examples/browser/codec.html](https://github.com/carsonDB/frameflow/blob/main/examples/browser/codec.html). To run this example, please follow the [guides](https://github.com/carsonDB/frameflow#more-examples).
